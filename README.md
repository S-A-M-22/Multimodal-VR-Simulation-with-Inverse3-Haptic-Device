| Heading | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Background** <br> *The context for this project.* | This project involves developing a desktop-based virtual reality (VR) simulation using Unity, integrated with the Inverse3 haptic device, to allow medical students and professionals to interact with virtual environments and receive realistic force feedback. The simulation will be designed primarily for training in basic procedural skills such as needle insertion and blood collection, with the aim of improving realism, safety, and accessibility in skill acquisition, and with the prospects of adding more features in the future. |
| **Aim** <br> *Purpose of the project.* | The purpose of this project is to sync the VR environment, Unity application, and haptic device to create a smooth, immersive experience. The focus will be on real-time interaction, accurate physical response, and device communication. |
| **Objectives (SMART)** <br> *Goals of the project.* | - Achieve full, stable communication between Unity, the Inverse3 haptic device, and Meta Quest 3 headset <br> - Implement at least 3 distinct material profiles with recognisably different haptic feedback <br> - Ensure system latency for haptic and VR interactions remains <50ms end-to-end, measured via Unity profiler <br> - Develop and calibrate a syringe insertion and blood draw scenario with haptic resistance values aligned to realistic tissue properties <br> - Conduct user testing with at least X participants, aiming for ≥ 80% correct identification of material profiles in blind trials <br> - Deliver complete technical documentation, integration notes, and a user guide |
| **Success Criteria** <br> *What does success look like for the sponsor and how can it be measured.* | - The Unity VR application integrates seamlessly with the Inverse3 haptic device, producing accurate, real-time haptic feedback (<50ms latency) <br> - Users can reliably distinguish between at least three different material profiles in blind tests (≥ 80% accuracy) <br> - Syringe-tissue simulation accurately and consistently delivers tactile feedback that matches expected resistance values based on medical training references <br> - The application runs stably on the designated desktop VR setup without noticeable frame drops or desynchronisation <br> - The project is completed on schedule to meet deliverables of the project scope, tracked via monitoring completion of key deliverables, signed off by the client <br> - System architecture is modular and supports future feature expansion, assessed by reviewing the system for flexibility |
| **Outputs** <br> *List the outputs that will be produced as part of the project including the final product or service.* | - A functional Unity VR desktop application <br> - Integration of the Inverse3 haptic device with Meta Quest VR headset for real-time synchronised interactions <br> - Library of at least three calibrated interactive materials with corresponding haptic profiles <br> - Syringe insertion and blood draw simulation with realistic tactile resistance <br> - Technical documentation, including: <br> • API integration guide for the haptic device <br> • Developer startup instructions <br> • Quick-start user guide <br> - User testing report summarising methodology, results, and recommendations |
| **Scope** <br> *The work that needs to be accomplished in order to deliver/complete the project.* | - Unity development to integrate the haptic device and VR headset <br> - Implementation of three calibrated material profiles for distinct tactile feedback <br> - Development of the syringe-tissue simulation scenario <br> - Real-time performance tuning to maintain latency under 50ms <br> - Basic 3D models sufficient for functional training purposes (not high-detail visualisation) |
| **Out of Scope** <br> *Work you are not required to deliver as part of your project.* | - Ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, or post-project updates after delivery <br> - Multi-user or networked VR interactions <br> - High-detail 3D modelling or advanced environment design <br> - Cross-platform VR support (project is limited to desktop + Meta Quest 3) <br> - Complex physics simulations beyond the realism required for training purposes |
| **Milestones** <br> *Key checkpoints with the client e.g. client deployment, approval deadlines.* | - **Week 3:** 3D modelling finalised (prototype) <br> - **Week 4:** Haptic device and VR headset basic communication in Unity <br> - **Week 6:** Full VR-haptic sync achieved with basic material feedback <br> - **Week 8:** Material library implemented and calibrated <br> - **Week 10:** Syringe-tissue simulation first iteration complete <br> - **Week 11:** Performance tuning and latency verification <br> - **Week 12:** User testing completed <br> - **Week Final:** Documentation delivery and project sign-off |
| **Human Resources** <br> *Are there other specialist staff or subject matter experts that will participate?* | - Project team members <br> - Access to FMH Media Lab staff for validating simulation accuracy (error thresholds) |
| **Other Resources** <br> *Are there other resources to be utilized in the project? Data? Equipment?* | - Unity development tools (C# scripting) <br> - Meta Quest SDK <br> - Inverse3 haptic device SDK/API <br> - Access to Meta Quest 3 headset and Inverse3 hardware via FMH Media Lab <br> - Reference data for realistic tissue resistance values (from literature/client) <br> - Client-provided technical documentation for Inverse3 and Meta Quest + existing internet resources/assets |
| **Reporting / Meeting Frequency** <br> *With what regularity will the team meet with the client and report to the client.* | - Weekly progress meetings with client to review milestone status, address issues, and agree on next steps <br> - Written progress summaries sent before each meeting |
